It's been a long time since I've been wanting to write on so many things. And every time I have some excuses on not to. Honestly it's cause I'm bad at it and also that I'm afraid to be judged. But I just love reading and I've been moved by so many beautiful writings that I've come across. I believe these people are truly blessed with powers who could take out their feelings into beautiful words which could totally touch others hearts as well as minds. Anyway, coming to my writing, I have no  plan to have such powers (I surely wish to have like being invisible) but I want to write to keep memories for now. So I'm going to start my journey of writing from very primary level.

Apart from my love of reading, I enjoy hiking and trekking. Who doesn't like to be in nature right? Luckily, [Himalay](https://himalay.com.np/) (my husband) is as enthusiastic as I am when it comes to hiking/trekking. However, the last time I went on a trek was on October, 2017 (not been able to go on any trek has its own personal reasons) and  it had been 6-7 months since I hiked around the valley and I missed it all the time. When autumn started we didn't want to wait anymore so I, along with my husband, created our group called "weekend hikers" in our office for hiking enthusiasts. To go on a hike every Saturday was not possible for us so we planned to do it in every two weeks.

On November 16, weekend hikers included me, [Himalay](https://himalay.com.np/), Asmita and [Anmol](http://anmolchalise.com.np/) went to Jamacho Gumba as our first destination. Jamacho Gumba lies at top of Shivapuri Nagarjun National park. [Himalay](https://himalay.com.np/) and I had been to Jamacho many times before and it is one of our favorite spot to hike, however, this was the first time for [Anmol](http://anmolchalise.com.np/) and Asmita and we are glad that they enjoyed it as much as we do every time we go there. We all met at Balaju bypass and from the entry gate of the national park, we started our hike. Since this is a national park, it is well guarded by Nepal Army. After the purchase of tickets, they duly noted the name, mobile number and number of persons in each group before entering the gate. Rules regarding the national park are printed on the notice board as well as each ticket. First 20-30 minutes of the hike which included steep stairs were the hardest which we all quietly adjusted to without speaking much and heavy sweating. Then we reached to army check point where they again noted phone number and count. From there, more enjoyable trail started and the rest of the journey was filled with our talks on so many topics which I don't think any of us remember now. Next time I'll write about our next hike to Shivapuri.
