Life is full of surprises. We are in constant need to fill ourselves, whether it be with a perfect job or partner or that dress you saw on a dummy while coming home. Also, we are in habit to constantly compare ourselves with others, be it the result of our upbringing, society or now social media age. Grand weddings, exotic vacation, perfect jewelry, or dress, or bag, or shoes, everything needs to be perfect. In this competitive era, we are driving ourselves every day, pushing ourselves to be in this race, to show off that we are no less. Well, it's not a total waste of time and effort at all, we do get reward with likes and comments and especially the satisfaction we get when we see or just feel the jealousy coming from our friends, relatives, colleagues. To be a little ahead than some people will certainly compensate for those hard works for a little while, maybe? And unless there are some driving factors, how to spend this short/long lifespan. So this chasing, racing along with some timely rewards that motivate us to keep going forward seems necessary. People would say there are lots of things that this world needs and we should put our time and efforts to such deeds rather than competing on who take extravagant vacations. And they are right! Whatever be it, living for ourselves or others, it should keep us on the track of "living life". However, in my opinion, it is equally important to finding the right kind of motivation, those that our heart and soul both comply with. Is living for yourself enough?

_P.S. Random thoughts that came across my mind 2 years ago which seems like incomplete but posting it anyway._
