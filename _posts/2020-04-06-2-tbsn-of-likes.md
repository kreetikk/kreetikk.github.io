Life is full of surprises. We are in constant need to fill ourselves, whether it be with a perfect job or partner or that dress you saw on a dummy while coming home. Also, we are in the habit of constantly comparing ourselves with others, be it the result of our upbringing, society, or now social media age. Grand weddings, exotic vacations, perfect jewelry, designer dresses or bags or shoes, we desire everything exclusive. In this modern era, we are driving ourselves every day, pushing ourselves to be in this race, to show off that we are no less. Well, it's not a total waste of time and effort when we get rewarded with likes and comments and especially the satisfaction we get when we see or feel or want to show that we are a little ahead in this life race. To be a little ahead than some people may compensate for those hard works for a little while, maybe? And unless there are some driving factors or say life purpose, how do we spend this short/long life? What motivates us to live? So this chasing, racing along with some timely rewards which motivate us to keep going forward seems necessary many times. Many would say there are lots of things that this world needs and we should put our time, money, and resources to provide to the less fortunate rather than competing on who take extravagant vacations. And they are right! Whatever be, living for ourselves or others, it should keep us on the track of "living life". It is hard to find something that our hearts and soul both comply with. Till then, it's okay to live our life finding that purpose and competing here and there.

_P.S. Random thoughts that came across my mind some 2 years ago which seems like incomplete but posting it anyway._
