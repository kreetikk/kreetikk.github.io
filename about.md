I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Merchantrade since June 2016. I am mainly involved in Remittance based projects, gather requirements and design and develop modules accordingly. Previously, I worked for Software Paradigm International (SPI) as a Software Engineer from Jan 2015, where I was involved in design and development of retail software project. Pathway Technologies and Services was the first company where I started my career as a Junior-developer in Jan 2014.
